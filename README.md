# Book Versioning Scheme

## Summary

_Book Versioning_ is a versioning scheme developed to track changes between editions of published works. Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.CORRECTION, increment the

1. MAJOR version whenever you introduce new content that does not align with old content, making it severely outdated;
2. MINOR version whenever you introduce new content that aligns with old content, thus supplementing it;
3. CORRECTION version whenever you make editorial changes or add clarifications that do not significantly alter old content or its meaning.

## Introduction

Publications come in editions. Newer ones often contain corrections and new content; it is usually safe to assume edition 7 is preferred over edition 6. However, the edition number gives little information about the nature of the difference between the editions. Moreover, the definition of an edition varies a lot, resulting in much confusion, especially for the reader.

As an example, a student looking for a textbook might make do with edition 6 instead of edition 7 if the changes between the editions are minor editorial changes. If, however, edition 7 comes with major, significant changes, great consideration should go into making a decision between the editions. The word "revised" is often added to make some distinction but its practical usefulness is highly questionable.

Similarly, a treatise of a more personal nature might stay relevant in subject, but the author may have had a change of heart, wanting to revisit the topic. Such progress in thought often manifests itself in new books instead of new editions which makes recognising and following this progress much more difficult for the reader.

We propose to version publication editions in a way that allows and encourages authors to make even drastic changes to their works, while at the same time making the nature of the changes between different editions immediately evident.

This versioning scheme of publication editions is named "Book Versioning," and it is presented in detail in the subsequent section. Since this versioning scheme is easily applied to all text, the scheme itself is versioned under it.

Book Versioning is heavily inspired by the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) scheme that is widely used in software development.
